    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "During the data exploration, we discovered several facts and elements which helped to the discovery of the important features that influence the impact of an offer or not. Some of the facts discovered are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* There are more males than females as customers during the capture of the datasets\n",
    "* Women earn more than men in average and spend more money on Starbucks\n",
    "* Salaries between women and men become significant different after the age of 45\n",
    "* The offers from Starbucks target mostly customers between 38-60 years old.\n",
    "* Membership grow between man and women tends to grow every year. However, men in 2017 and 2018 are dominant.\n",
    "* Currently men receive more offers or promotions than women.\n",
    "* Men tend to view more the offers received than women.\n",
    "* It seems that the offers are completed by male and females and the gap is not big specially for reward 5 and 10.\n",
    "* Women spend more money than men, receive less offers because they view less offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, three models were added in order to extend the analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linear regression**: Used to predict the amount spent in Starbucks products regardless the offer completion and based on different features, it was clear that the top features to predict the amount are driven by 'receive an offer' and the level of 'income'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logistic regression**: Used to classify now users who completed the offers or not. This one had high accuracy but low recall and the top features that influence the user are that they receive an offer and the age.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **XG Boost**: Used to improve classification with very low RMSE of 0.077445 after 49 optimization rounds. This tree considers 'income', 'age', 'gender' as the top features to persuade the user to complete an offer.\n"

    "### Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "During the implementation of the case of study, I detected different potential improvements that can help to increase the quality of this analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demographics of the data, there are some pieces of information that could have been useful for the analysis, such as city, location, educational level, etc. This could have perhaps allowed designing a better strategy to clean and perhaps split the data into different subcategories.\n",
    "* Based on the data it seems that it is worth it to split the dataset between males and females and perform the models in each of these datasets in order to find deeper insights. In the current analysis, both categories were together and they may be cases, where the recall was very low, which means that there were cases hard to classify.\n",
    "* Fine-tuning the parameters of the algorithms is still a task for improvements. At the time only basic and standard configuration was added. However, more experimentation on hyperparameters could have helped to understand better the users and their response to the offers.\n",
    "* Make some dimensionality reduction in terms of features. It would have been a good suggestion to apply some techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis(PCA) for features, in order to perform better classifications. Sometimes taking all the features, just bias sometimes the classifications.\n",
    "* If a good algorithm or model is found, a study of how many rows of data are needed in order to reach a certain accuracy or prediction is a must for fine-tune performance. In terms of computational efficiency, it is important to train our models with enough amount of information without adding more information that does not improve the algorithm.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Men are already taking advantage of the offers and they are passive customers who continuously show off for buying Starbucks products, the strategy here should continue to offer even more aggressive discounts by combining rewards and difficulty. Men tend to go for a higher reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Women have a high potential to increase the revenue, Starbucks needs to focus more on women. It would be interesting to create only products for them and make specific offers for women. For the moment the BOGO offer is applied to men and women. However, if we can make something more personalized for women then that would be the direction to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Women have very interesting and predictable consumer behavior based on different studies and it would be interesting to sell an experience to women instead to have only BOGO.\n"
